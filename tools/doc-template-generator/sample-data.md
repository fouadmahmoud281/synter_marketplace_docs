### Prerequisites

```
Syntera account with admin access
API key with inference permissions
Basic understanding of LLM concepts
Familiarity with REST APIs
```

### Workflow Overview

```
Workflow Title: LLM Inference Endpoint Setup Workflow

Phase Names:
Browse Model Catalog
Configure Inference Settings
Create Dedicated Endpoint
Test and Monitor
```

### Phase 1: Browse Model Catalog

```
Phase Intro: Start by exploring the available models in the Syntera Model Catalog. You can filter models by type, size, and capabilities to find the one that best suits your needs.

Feature Grid:

Feature Title: Model Search
Feature Description: Search for models by name, provider, or capabilities

Feature Title: Model Comparison
Feature Description: Compare performance metrics across different models

Feature Title: Version History
Feature Description: View previous versions and their performance characteristics

Action Steps:

Step Highlight: Navigate to Catalog
Step Note: From the main dashboard, click on "Model Catalog" in the left navigation panel

Step Highlight: Apply Filters
Step Note: Use the filter options to narrow down models by type (e.g., text generation, embedding)

Step Highlight: Select Model
Step Note: Click on a model card to view detailed information and select it for your endpoint

Callout Info: Models marked with a âš¡ symbol are optimized for low-latency inference and are recommended for production applications.

Code Block:
# Example API call to list available models
curl -X GET "https://api.syntera.ai/v1/models" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Phase 2: Configure Inference Settings

```
Phase Intro: After selecting a model, you'll need to configure the inference settings to optimize for your specific use case. These settings affect performance, cost, and output quality.

Feature Grid:

Feature Title: Parameter Tuning
Feature Description: Adjust temperature, top-p, and other generation parameters

Feature Title: Resource Allocation
Feature Description: Configure compute resources for your endpoint

Feature Title: Caching Options
Feature Description: Enable result caching to improve performance for repeated queries

Action Steps:

Step Highlight: Access Settings
Step Note: From the model details page, click "Configure Inference"

Step Highlight: Adjust Parameters
Step Note: Set the temperature (0.0-1.0) based on your creativity needs

Step Highlight: Save Configuration
Step Note: Click "Save Settings" to store your configuration

Callout Info: Lower temperature values (0.1-0.3) produce more deterministic outputs, while higher values (0.7-1.0) produce more creative and varied responses.

Code Block:
# Example configuration JSON
{
  "model": "syntera-llm-7b",
  "parameters": {
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_p": 0.95,
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "frequency_penalty": 0.0,
    "presence_penalty": 0.0
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Create Dedicated Endpoint

```
Phase Intro: Now that you've selected a model and configured inference settings, you can create a dedicated endpoint. This provides a persistent URL that you can use to make inference requests.

Feature Grid:

Feature Title: Endpoint Creation
Feature Description: Set up a dedicated URL for your inference requests

Feature Title: Scaling Options
Feature Description: Configure auto-scaling based on traffic patterns

Feature Title: Access Control
Feature Description: Manage authentication and rate limiting for your endpoint

Action Steps:

Step Highlight: Create Endpoint
Step Note: Click "Create Dedicated Endpoint" button on the configuration page

Step Highlight: Name Your Endpoint
Step Note: Enter a unique name that identifies the purpose of this endpoint

Step Highlight: Set Access Controls
Step Note: Configure authentication methods and allowed origins

Callout Info: For production deployments, we recommend enabling request logging and monitoring to track usage patterns and detect potential issues.

Code Block:
# Creating an endpoint via API
curl -X POST "https://api.syntera.ai/v1/endpoints" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-production-endpoint",
    "model_id": "syntera-llm-7b",
    "config": {
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "max_tokens": 1024
    },
    "scaling": {
      "min_replicas": 1,
      "max_replicas": 5
    }
  }'
```

### Phase 4: Test and Monitor

```
Phase Intro: After creating your endpoint, it's important to test it thoroughly and set up monitoring to ensure optimal performance. This phase guides you through testing procedures and monitoring options.

Feature Grid:

Feature Title: Endpoint Testing
Feature Description: Validate your endpoint with sample requests

Feature Title: Performance Metrics
Feature Description: Monitor latency, throughput, and error rates

Feature Title: Cost Tracking
Feature Description: Track usage and associated costs

Action Steps:

Step Highlight: Send Test Requests
Step Note: Use the testing console to send sample prompts to your endpoint

Step Highlight: Review Metrics
Step Note: Navigate to the Monitoring dashboard to view performance data

Step Highlight: Set Up Alerts
Step Note: Configure alerts for error rates or latency thresholds

Callout Info: We recommend setting up both performance and cost alerts to avoid unexpected issues or charges. You can configure these in the Monitoring section.

Code Block:
# Example inference request to your endpoint
curl -X POST "https://api.syntera.ai/v1/endpoints/my-production-endpoint/generate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms",
    "max_tokens": 100
  }'
```

### Troubleshooting

```
Question: Why am I getting timeout errors?
Solution Label: Connection Issues
Solution Description: Timeout errors often occur due to network connectivity problems or when the model is processing a particularly complex request. Try increasing the request timeout in your client code or breaking down complex prompts into smaller chunks.

Question: How do I reduce latency for my endpoint?
Solution Label: Performance Optimization
Solution Description: To reduce latency, consider using a smaller model variant, enabling caching for repeated queries, or upgrading to a dedicated instance with more resources. Also, keep prompt lengths as short as possible while maintaining context.

Question: Why are my inference costs higher than expected?
Solution Label: Cost Management
Solution Description: Unexpected costs can result from high traffic, inefficient prompts, or using larger models than necessary. Review your usage patterns in the cost dashboard, optimize prompts to use fewer tokens, and consider using distilled models for simpler tasks.
